This is the source code for my personal website
------------

This dynamic site is built using MongoDB Angular.js Express, Node.js at its core. I am able to add projects to my portfolio by uploading the schema formatted info to the Mongo Database hosted at mlab. I use Mongoose to create queries and the projects are formatted with angular directives and tidied up on the page with flexbox. The site is currently hosted on Heroku's platform.  

Some future things I would like to implement into this project are:
* Better overall design & layout
* Optimized images for both size and quality
* Additional interactivity & animations  

Check out this site and let me know what you think.
