Their old site was built on WordPress but the theme was built custom for them so some support and features were lacking. This was an interesting job working with the old code base and seeing a lot of commented out boiler plate and a mix of \"best practices.\" Since a lot of the WordPress work I am tasked with is working with conservative budgets, I usually have to make do with as much of the client's legacy code as possible. In this project there were some dynamic tables populated from some custom grouping and post types behind the scenes. Guardian wanted to keep that functionality, but it was a mixed bag of code in the page templates with PHP, jQuery, and vanilla JavaScript. In the end everything was hooked up and working, matched the design comps responsively, and looking amazing!",
